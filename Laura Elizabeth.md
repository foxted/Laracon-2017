# Laura Elizabeth - UX/UI Design

Debugging design, 5 steps:

1. Finding great colours
2. Choosing the font
3. Hierarchy
4. Layout
5. Polish

## Colours
- Choose your colour
- Choose a shade
- dribbble.com/colors
- paletton.com

## Fonts
- Choosing 2 typefaces is easier than 1
- Make them different enough
- Serif/Sans-serif
- fontpair.co

## Hierarchy
- Simplify navigation
- Make headings different to help with hierarchy
- Write engaging first heading
- Spacing between sections

## Layouts
- Draw sketches
- Modular scale
- type-scale.com
- 45-75 characters per line

## Spacing
- Lack of spacing is a major issue
- Pick one unit and use as a base

## Polish
- Use outline buttons if button are too prominent
- If page lack colours, use colours on headings
- To isolate section, use light background
- Make link interesting with icons and style
- Make capitalization consistent
- Make grid sections for features, services
- With section having a background colour, easier on the eyes to centre headlines
- Make CTA obvious
